This repository features a Ruby on Rails application designed to dynamically evaluate and display password strength. Leveraging the robustness of Rails for the backend and incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive front-end, the project offers a visually engaging interface. Users can receive instant feedback on their password's security level, enhanced by the aesthetic use of Google Fonts. This application serves as an excellent tool for developers looking to embed password strength validations into their projects or as an educational resource for promoting better cybersecurity practices.
